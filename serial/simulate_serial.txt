1. Install the following packages on Ubuntu:

sudo apt install screen
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/

screen has been deprecated and replaced by tmux in rhel.

tmux doesn't seem to support serial comms


sudo apt install socat
https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/getting-started-socat

2. Start the device in GNS3 and find out the port to which the telnet console is mapped

On Ubuntu execute: ps -ef | grep telnet


In this example, the port is 5008.


3. In a terminal, execute the next command to map the telnet port to a virtual serial port:

socat pty,link=/home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 tcp:localhost:5008


4. In another terminal, execute the next command to initiate a session:

screen /home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0 9600


After, we press ENTER and close the terminal when the device prompt has appeared.


In the first terminal, we press Ctrl+c to cancel the socat command, and we execute the same one more time.

socat pty,link=/home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 tcp:localhost:5008


socat pty,link=/home/ubunt/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 TCP4:172.16.0.1:23
screen /home/ubuntu/ttyS0 9600
socat pty,link=/home/ubunt/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 TCP4:172.16.0.1:23
